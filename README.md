# Next.js API Routes Data Fetching Inside Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications where data fetching is performed within a component using API routes.  This approach leads to unexpected behavior, including hydration mismatches and potential errors.

## The Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to fetch data from an API route (`/api/data`) directly inside the component.  This is problematic because the data fetching happens on the client-side after the initial render, potentially causing a mismatch between the server-rendered HTML and the client-side state.

## The Solution

The correct approach involves fetching data during the build process (using `getStaticProps`) or at request time on the server (using `getServerSideProps`).  This ensures that the data is available before the component renders, preventing hydration mismatches.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`. You'll observe an error in the console as the data fetching is not handled correctly within the component.

## How to fix

Check `aboutSolution.js` for the corrected implementation using `getServerSideProps`.
